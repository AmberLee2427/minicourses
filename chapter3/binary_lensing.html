              <p>The total deflection is the vector sum of the deflections

              <p>E.g. a ray which intersects the lens plane at &xi; = (x1, y1),
            has a total deflection for a lens with i = 1 - n masses of:</p>

            $$\bar{\alpha}(\bar{\xi}) = \sum_{i}\left( \frac{4GM_{i}}{c^{2}}\frac{\bar{\xi} - \bar{\xi_{i}}}{|\bar{\xi} - \bar{\xi_{i}}|^{2}}\right),$$

      <section>
          <h2>Deflection for a binary lens</h2>
          <p>For a binary lens this becomes:</p>

        $$\bar{\alpha}(\bar{\xi}) = \frac{4GM_{1}}{c^{2}}\frac{\bar{\xi} - \bar{\xi_{1}}}{|\bar{\xi} - \bar{\xi_{1}}|^{2}} + \frac{4GM_{2}}{c^{2}}\frac{\bar{\xi} - \bar{\xi_{2}}}{|\bar{\xi} - \bar{\xi_{2}}|^{2}},$$

      <section>
          <h1>The Binary Lens Equation</h1>
          <p>We now write the lens equation in a form relating the lightray origin in
              the source plane (&eta;(u,&nu;)) to the total deflection angle:</p>
          $$\bar{\eta} = \bar{\xi}\frac{D_{S}}{D_{L}} - D_{LS}\bar{\alpha}(\bar{\xi}),$$

            <p>By substituting, we get:</p>

            $$\frac{\bar{\eta}}{D_{S}} = \frac{\bar{\xi}}{D_{L}} - \frac{4GM_{1}}{c^{2}}\frac{\bar{\xi} - \bar{\xi_{1}}}{|\bar{\xi} - \bar{\xi_{1}}|^{2}}\frac{D_{LS}}{D_{S}} - \frac{4GM_{2}}{c^{2}}\frac{\bar{\xi} - \bar{\xi_{2}}}{|\bar{\xi} - \bar{\xi_{2}}|^{2}}\frac{D_{LS}}{D_{S}},$$

      <section>
          <h1>The Binary Lens Equation</h1>
          <p>This is simplified by declaring:</p>

                    <td>$$\bar{w}(u,\nu) = \frac{\bar{\eta}}{D_{S}},$$</td>
                    <td>$$\bar{z}(x,y) = \frac{\bar{\xi}}{D_{L}},$$</td>

                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>and we arrive at:</p>

            $$\bar{w} = \bar{z} - m_{1}\frac{\bar{z} - \bar{z_{1}}}{|\bar{z} - \bar{z_{1}}|^{2}} - m_{2}\frac{\bar{z} - \bar{z_{1}}}{|\bar{z} - \bar{z_{1}}|^{2}},$$

          <h2>Mapping between the lens and source planes</h2>
          <p>This represents a mapping between the source and lens planes: </p>
          <p>A lightray from point w&#772;(u,&nu;) in the source plane will hit the lens
              plane at z&#772;(x,y). </p>
          <p>The inverse problem - extracting the locations of the
              source images in the lens plane geometry - requires complex root-finding
              techniques explored in detail by Schneider & Weiss (1986). </p>
          <p>In complex notation, </p>

            <table width="75%">
                <tr>
                    <td>$$w = z - m_{1}\frac{1}{\bar{z} - \bar{z_{1}}} - m_{2}\frac{1}{\bar{z} - \bar{z_{2}}},$$</td>
                    <td>$$w = u + i\nu,$$</td>
                    <td>$$z = x = iy,$$</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>where w, z are complex numbers and z&#772; is the complex conjugate of z.</p>

      </section>

      <section>
          <h1>Source Images</h1>
          <p>To find the number and locations of the source images produced we need to
              produce an expression for z in terms of w - the inverse of the lens
              equation. The complex conjugate of the binary lens equation is:</p>

            $$\bar{w} = \bar{z} - m_{1}\frac{1}{z - z_{1}} - m_{2}\frac{1}{z - z_{2}}$$

      </section>

      <section>
          <h1>Source Images</h1>
          <p>Solving this expression for z&#772; and substituting, we get:</p>

        $$z = w + \sum_{i=1,2}m_{i}\left[\bar{w} - \bar{z_{i}} + \sum_{k=1,2}m_{k}(z - z_{k})^{-1}\right]^{-1}$$

          <p>This expression generates a polynomial equation in z of order
              (n<sup>2</sup> + 1), where n is the number of lensing masses.</p>
            <p>For a binary lens, there are up to 5 solutions, of which either
                3 or 5 may be real, depending on the lens-source projected separation.  </p>

          <h2>Amplification for a binary lens</h2>
          <p>In order to calculate the magnification of a binary lens, we can take a similar
              approach to that for a single lens, and calculate the inverse of the area
              distortion of the lens mapping:</p>

            $$A = \left| det \frac{\partial\bar{w}(u,\nu)}{\partial\bar{z}(x,y)} \right|^{-1},$$
      </section>

      <section>
          <h2>Amplification for a binary lens</h2>
          <p>To derive an expression for this we need the 'gradient' of a vector function, or
              the matrix of first-order partial derivatives, known as the Jacobian matrix.
              This may be written:</p>
                <table width="75%">
                    <tr>
                        <td>$$J = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \\ \frac{\partial \nu}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial \nu}{\partial y} \end{bmatrix}$$</td>
                        <td>$$J = \left| \frac{\partial w}{\partial z} \right|^{2} - \left|\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}\right|^{2},$$</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Amplification for a binary lens</h2>
          <p>For n lensing bodies, the Jacobian is:</p>

            $$J = 1 - \left[ \sum_{n} m_{n}(\bar{z} - \bar{z_{n}})^{-2}\right]^{2} = 1 - (\bar{\kappa})^{2},$$

        <p>and for a binary lens is:</p>

            $$J = 1 - \left( \frac{m_{1}}{(\bar{z} - \bar{z_{1}})^{2}} + \frac{m_{2}}{(\bar{z} - \bar{z_{2}})^{2}}\right)^{2},$$

        <p>The inverse Jacobian matrix elements are:</p>

        <table width="75%">
            <tr>
                <td>$$\frac{\partial z}{\partial w} = \frac{1}{J},$$</td>
                <td>$$\frac{\partial z}{\partial \bar{w}} = -\frac{\bar{\kappa}}{J},$$</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Amplification for a binary lens</h2>
          <p>The total amplification is given by the sum of the absolute amplification of each image i:</p>

            $$A = \sum_{i=1}^{n}A_{i} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}|\det J|^{-1}.$$
      </section>

      <section>
          <h1>Critical Curves</h1>
          <p>Mathematically, the nature of this solution has a curious feature. </p>
          <p>As the source moves behind the binary lens, there are certain
        positions in the source plane for which the resulting Jacobian determinant
              drops to zero.

        <p>These positions form graceful curves, known as 'critical curves'.</p>
        <p>Theoretically, as the source crosses the critical curve, the magnification
            becomes inifinite. In reality, finite source effects curtail it to merely
            'high', but these situations can still result in very dramatic
            brightenings of the source by several magnitudes.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
          <h1>Caustics</h1>
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-6">

          />
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm-6">
            <p>Applying the lens equation, the positions of the critical curve in the source
                plane can be mapped into the lens plane geometry -
                resulting in generally spiky curves known as 'caustics'.
            </p>
                  <p>This plot shows the loop of the critical curve in the source plane and
                      the spiky caustic in the central region between the
                      masses.  The straight line indicates the source's relative motion during
                      the event.
                  </p>
              </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1>Number of Lensed Images</h1>
          <p>The number of images changes as the source moves across the caustic curve. </p>
          <p>Outside of it, there are 3 images; one outside the critical curve and two
              inside it, usually close to one of the masses. </p>
          <p>Two more images exist within the region defined by the caustic - one inside
              and one outside the critical curve. </p>
          <p>Its interesting to bear in mind that the caustic curve represents the
              maximum magnification, and within the caustic this can actually
              drop.</p>
          <p>For wide binary lenses, the magnification mid-caustic can drop back almost
              to baseline.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
          <h1>Caustic variety</h1>
          <p>The expressions derived here depend on the ratio, q, of the masses of the
              lensing bodies and their positions in the lens plane, relative to the
              angular separation of the source as a function of time.</p>
            <p>These factors dictate the shape and extent of the caustics and a wide
                variety of shapes are possible. </p>
      </section>

      <section>
          <h2>Caustics and Source Trajectories</h2>
          <p>The source can take any trajectory, relative to the lens geometry, so the
              lightcurve for the same binary lens can look quite different depending on
          the angle of incidence.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
          <h2>Double-horned peaks</h2>
          <p>A wide range of lightcurves can result, but one common feature is a
              'double-peak' structure - the first peak caused by the source crossing into
              the caustic region, the second caused by it exiting the caustic.</p>

          <p>Depending on the size of the caustic, the trajectory and relative velocity,
              the peaks can be hours or days apart.</p>
      </section>

        <section>
            <h1>Planetary caustics</h1>
            <p>Notice though, that a binary lens of any q will produce caustics. </p>
            <p>As a result, provided the source has a favourable relative trajectory,
                even an extreme mass ratio binary like a planetary system will produce
                a detectable magnification. </p>
            <p>This makes microlensing uniquely sensitive to even low mass planetary
                companions. </p>
            <p>The caustic region for low mass ratio lenses is generally smaller, so the
            crossing time (the duration of the anomaly) is usually shorter
                - so higher cadence lightcurves are required to to characterize them. </p>
            <p>The probability of the source trajectory crossing the caustic is also
                smaller, but this is factor compensated for by surveys covering
                large numbers of stars.</p>
