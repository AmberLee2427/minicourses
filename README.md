# Microlensing Mini Course (2025)

Welcome to the repository for the **Microlensing Mini Course**, developed by the [Roman Galactic Exoplanet Surveyor Preparatory Investigations Team (RGES-PIT)](https://rges-pit.org/). This minicourse is designed for select students to participate in Roman Space Telescope-related lectures and activities, with a focus on gravitational microlensing science. The virtual lectures were held in May 2025, and all materials are available here and on the [course landing page](https://rges-pit.org/outreach_mini_landing/).

## üöÄ How to Use

You can run the Jupyter notebooks in two ways:

- **Google Colab**: Click the "Open in Colab" badge next to each notebook link for a one-click, cloud-based experience (no installation required).
- **Locally**: Clone this repository and install the required dependencies (see below).

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/minicourses.git
   cd minicourses
   ```
2. (Recommended) Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies (see `chapter4/requirements.txt`):
   ```bash
   pip install -r chapter4/requirements.txt
   ```
4. Launch Jupyter Lab or Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   # or
   jupyter notebook
   ```
5. Open the desired notebook from the appropriate chapter directory.

## üë©‚Äçüéì Audience
